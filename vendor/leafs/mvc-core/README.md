[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/mvc-core/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/mvc-core)
[![Total Downloads](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/mvc-core/downloads)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/mvc-core)
[![License](https://poser.pugx.org/leafs/mvc-core/license)](https://packagist.org/packages/leafs/mvc-core)

This is a package holding core files specific to MVC based leaf frameworks like Leaf MVC and Leaf API. MVC core holds functionality like shortcut functions and helpers which can be used throughout your application.

## üì¶ Installation

You can quickly get leaf mvc core up and running with the leaf cli

```sh
leaf install mvc-core
```

or with composer

```bash
composer require leafs/mvc-core
```

## Including in earlier versions

You can include mvc core in earlier versions of [Leaf MVC](https://mvc.leafphp.dev) and [Leaf API](https://api.leafphp.dev) manually simply by removing the already existing `Config/functions.php` and `Config/bootstrap.php` files. That's it.

## üóÇ Basic Usage

Basically, MVC Core provides everything you need to transform your basic leaf app into a full-blown MVC framework without manually pulling in dependencies from all over the internet. Leaf MVC core is basically tailored to Leaf and binds all separate MVC features together.

## üß© Components

MVC Core comes with:

- Api Controllers
- Controllers
- Database & Models
- Factories
- Models
- Schemas
- Tons of MVC and module globals

The full documentation is covered in Leaf MVC and Leaf API, as well as Skeleton. This is because MVC core is used together with Leaf MVC, Leaf API and Skeleton.
